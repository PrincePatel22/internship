      <pre>
        Here are some basic rules to create great font pairings:

        1. Complement
        It is always safe to find font pairings that complement one another.
        A great font combination should harmonize, without being too similar or too different.

        2. Use Font Superfamilies
        A font superfamily is a set of fonts designed to work well together. So, using different fonts within the same superfamily is safe.
        For example, the Lucida superfamily contains the following fonts: Lucida Sans, Lucida Serif, Lucida Typewriter Sans, Lucida Typewriter Serif
        and Lucida Math.

        3. Contrast is King
        Two fonts that are too similar will often conflict. However, contrasts, done the right way, brings out the best in each font.
        Example: Combining serif with sans serif is a well known combination.
        A strong superfamily includes both serif and sans serif variations of the same font (e.g. Lucida and Lucida Sans).

        4. Choose Only One Boss
        One font should be the boss. This establishes a hierarchy for the fonts on your page. This can be achieved by varying the size, weight 
        and color.
